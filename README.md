Thank a lot for the opportunity to interview with you! I really enjoyed this exercise. It did take me a bit longer than expected.

To run the site locally:
1. Make sure mysql is running locally
2. add a .env file with the following values:
    - OPENAI_API_KEY
    - DB_USER
    - DB_PASSWORD
3. In project root, run npm start to start back end
4. cd into `frontend` dir and run npm start to start front end
